**AlexNet** is a **deep learning** model created by **Alex Krizhevsky**, **Ilya Sutskever**, and **Geoffrey Hinton**. It became famous after it **won the 2012 ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC)** — beating all previous models by a huge margin.

It was the first deep learning model to **prove that Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** could dramatically improve image classification tasks when trained on large datasets using **GPUs**.

> 💡 **Think of AlexNet as the model that taught computers to “see” images like humans.**

## 🧠 What is Deep Learning?

**Deep Learning** is a type of **Machine Learning**, which is a subset of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.

Deep learning uses layers of artificial **neurons** to learn patterns from data — especially useful for large and complex data like **images**, **videos**, and **audio**.

---

## 👁️ What is Computer Vision?

**Computer Vision** is a field in AI that focuses on enabling machines to understand and process visual information such as images and videos.

Examples include:

- 🖼 Image Classification
- 🕵️ Object Detection
- 👤 Face Recognition
- 🧠 Medical Image Analysis

## 🧱 How Does AlexNet Work?

AlexNet is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** composed of:

- **Input Layer**: Accepts image input (e.g. 224x224 RGB images)
- **Convolutional Layers**: Detect edges, textures, patterns
- **ReLU Activations**: Add non-linearity (ReLU = Rectified Linear Unit)
- **Pooling Layers**: Downsample feature maps to reduce computation
- **Dropout**: Randomly disables neurons to prevent overfitting
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Combine features and make decisions
- **Output Layer**: Gives classification result

### 💡 Key Features of AlexNet

- ✅ Uses **ReLU** instead of traditional sigmoid/tanh
- 🧠 Trained using **GPUs** (faster computation)
- 🔁 Uses **Data Augmentation** (flipping, cropping, rotating images)
- 🛡️ Introduced **Dropout** to fight overfitting

## 🏆 Why is AlexNet Important?

In 2012, AlexNet **reduced the error rate from 25.7% to 16.4%** on ImageNet, a dataset with over **1 million labeled images** across **1,000 categories**.

It changed how the world looked at **deep learning**, and influenced almost every modern vision model that followed, including:

- VGG
- ResNet
- Inception
- EfficientNet
