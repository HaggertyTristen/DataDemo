## 1. What is Deep Learning?

**Deep Learning** is a subfield of **Machine Learning**, which is a branch of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**.

- It uses a structure called a **neural network**, which is inspired by how the human brain works.
- Deep learning models learn to recognize patterns from **large amounts of data**, such as images, audio, text, or video.
- Unlike traditional machine learning, deep learning can **automatically learn features** from raw data without requiring manual feature engineering.

## 2. What is Computer Vision?

**Computer Vision** is the field of AI focused on enabling machines to understand and process **visual information** like images and videos.

Common tasks include:

- Image classification (e.g., identifying objects in a photo)
- Object detection (e.g., finding faces in a crowd)
- Image segmentation (e.g., separating foreground from background)
- Scene understanding (e.g., recognizing a beach vs. a mountain)

## 3. Introduction to AlexNet

### 🔹 What is AlexNet?

AlexNet is a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** designed to perform **image classification**. It classifies images into one of many predefined categories.

In 2012, it won the ImageNet competition, reducing the top-5 error rate from **25.7% to 16.4%**, which was a **massive leap** in performance at the time.
